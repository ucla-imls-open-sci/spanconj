## Present Simple Tense

The Present Simple Tense is the most basic tense in Spanish. Its purpose is to describe actions in the present or very near future. For example, in English, using the present simple tense would look something like this:

::::
The cat eats
The cat swims
Lucy bathes the cat
Lucy bathes 
::::

## Figure

Here is a pie chart showing what percentage of verbs end with -ar, -er, and -ir

```{r pyramid, fig.alt = "pie chart of verb endings", fig.cap = "Percentage of Verb endings"}
pie(
  c("-Ar" = 80, "-Er" = 15, "-Ir" = 5), 
  init.angle = 315, 
  col = c("pink", "lavender", "skyblue"), 
  border = FALSE
)
```

In this figure, we can see that -ar verbs are the most common verb ending. To conjugate -ar verbs in the present simple tense, you must first get the word stem. Then, attach the endings in the table below to the verb stem depending on the subject performing the action
